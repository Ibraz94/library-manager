# This code is a simple library management system using Streamlit.
# It allows users to add, remove, search, and view books in their personal library.
# The library data is stored in a JSON file and loaded into the application state.
# The code includes functions for loading and saving the library, initializing the session state,
# and resetting the success message.
# The main function sets up the Streamlit app, creates tabs for different functionalities,
# and handles user interactions for adding, removing, searching, and viewing books.
# The app also provides statistics about the library, such as total books and read status.
# The sidebar allows users to navigate between different tabs.
# The code uses pandas for data manipulation and visualization.
# The app is designed to be user-friendly and provides feedback on actions taken.
# The code is structured to handle errors gracefully and provide informative messages to the user.
# The app is a great tool for managing personal libraries and keeping track of reading progress.
# The code is well-organized and follows best practices for Streamlit applications.
# The app can be further enhanced with additional features such as exporting the library data,
# importing books from external sources, and more advanced search options.
# The code is a great starting point for anyone looking to build a library management system
# using Streamlit and Python.
# The app can be easily customized and extended to meet specific user needs.
# The code is a great example of how to use Streamlit for building interactive web applications
# and managing data in Python.
# The app can be deployed on various platforms, making it accessible to a wide audience.
# The code is a great resource for anyone interested in learning about Streamlit and data management.
# The app can be used for personal use or as a prototype for a larger project.
# The code is a great example of how to use Python for building web applications
# and managing data effectively.
